### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a student from Poland in the **second year** of my **bachelor's degree** journey on an IT major classified by _ISCED_ as **software and applications development and analysis** and here is the link to an [official website](https://sylabus.uj.edu.pl/en/5/1/2/9/126?masterElement=9).

ðŸŒ± I am currently developing my C++ skills

<!--
#### TODO

During my studies, I learned a lot of stuff such as C++, Python, SQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, PHP, Kotlin, Bash, Linux, Blender, Computer Science, phpMyAdmin, Visual Studio Community, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio.

Unfortunately, my knowledge is not yet solidified, which is a point in my learning journey that I would like to focus on.
